      Quantitative Finance (QFin) UWA is a mathematical finance and financial technology club that affiliated with the University of Western Australiaâ€™s Societies Council in early 2021. At the time of affiliation, our 3 core objectives as a student run organisation were:
        <ul>
        <li>To provide a platform for interested individuals to get practical experience in the field of algorithmic and statistical trading</li>
        <li>To demystify the quantitative finance industry and prepare students for a career in the field</li>
        <li>To create an inclusive environment for students with a common interest in mathematics and finance to meet one another </li>
        </ul>
